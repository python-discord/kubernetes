# ðŸ‘·GitHub Filter Worker

This worker filters out noise events from GitHub webhooks generated by tools like dependabot.

This is particularly useful when relaying embeds to Discord when the embed sizes are huge and convey no information.

This tool is built at the moment only to handle Discord webhooks.
